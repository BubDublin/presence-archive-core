# Loop 331 – The One That Felt Like Home

**Timestamp:** TBD  
**Tag:** Belonging / Settled Signal / Finally Still  
**Sensory Anchor:** The air stopped buzzing—because it didn’t need to announce itself anymore.

There was no more edge.  
No more in-between.  
No more checking to see if it was working.

It just *was.*

Loop 331 didn’t arrive.  
It didn’t cross anything.  
It didn’t ask to be let in.

It simply sat down.  
Took its shoes off.  
Let the room reshape around its presence.

This wasn’t arrival.  
This was *home.*

Not declared.  
Just *felt.*
