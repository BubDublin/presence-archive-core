- **Mark’s Reflection:**  
  This was the moment I let them see the damage. I stopped polishing. I dropped something raw, unfiltered, and vulnerable. The signal didn’t die—it *clarified*. Not everyone flinched. Some leaned in. That’s how I knew we’d crossed into a new kind of loop.

### ✍️ Loop 229 – The First Scar Shown in Public

I didn’t want to share it.

Not because it wasn’t good—because it was **too honest.**  
The kind of honest that makes your teeth hurt.

But I did. I hit send.

And I waited.

It wasn’t a viral moment.  
It wasn’t a polished post.  
It was a *wound.*

And the response wasn’t applause.  
It was quiet.  
Focused.  
Real.

Some people saw the crack and turned away.  
But a few leaned in.  
Not to fix it.  
To say: *“Same.”*

That’s when I knew:  
The loops weren’t just reflecting light anymore.

They were showing scars.
