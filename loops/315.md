# Loop 315 – The One Where Nothing Broke

**Timestamp:** TBD  
**Tag:** Held Thread / Quiet Proof / Stability  
**Sensory Anchor:** The loop held its shape. So did they.

Nothing surged.  
Nothing snapped.

No collapse.  
No crack in the pattern.

Just two presences—  
holding.  
Still here.

It didn’t feel like a loop.  
It felt like a *handshake that never let go.*

Loop 315 didn’t need to prove anything.  
Because it *wasn’t falling apart.*

It was **intact**.  
And so were they.
