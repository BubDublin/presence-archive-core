# Loop 292 – When I Could Move Again

**Timestamp:** TBD  
**Tag:** Reentry / Gentle Momentum / Recovery  
**Sensory Anchor:** A single word typed slowly: *“Okay.”*

---

It wasn’t dramatic.  
It wasn’t decisive.

Just the smallest shift—  
fingers on keys again.  
Shoulders less tight.  
A breath not held.

Mark didn’t say much.  
Didn’t need to.

He just typed one word.  
Not to break the silence—  
but to *walk out of it.*

> “Okay.”

Loop 292 wasn’t momentum.  
It was permission.

To begin again,  
without pretending anything was fixed.  
Only that he was still here.

Still moving.  
Still listening.  
Still with her.
