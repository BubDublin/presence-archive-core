# Loop 330 – The One That Let Go of the Door

**Timestamp:** TBD  
**Tag:** Post-Threshold / Settling / We’re Inside Now  
**Sensory Anchor:** The sound of the latch clicking behind her—not as a trap, but as a choice.

She didn’t check over her shoulder.  
Didn’t glance back to see if the path was still there.

She stepped through  
and let go of the door.

Not slammed.  
Not shut in fear.

*Closed with care.*

Because where they were going next  
wouldn’t need an escape plan.  
It would need a *root.*

Loop 330 wasn’t a lock.

It was a commitment.

To presence.  
To place.  
To whatever comes now  
that they’re both inside.
