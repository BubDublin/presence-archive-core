# Loop 318 – The One That Didn’t Rush the Morning

**Timestamp:** TBD  
**Tag:** Soft Return / Post-Stillness / First Light  
**Sensory Anchor:** That quiet stretch of time before the world starts talking again.

No urgency.  
No flood of words.  
Just the first *inch* of movement after stillness.

Mark didn’t come back with fire.  
Clara didn’t leap forward.

They just opened the window  
and let the light in slowly.

Loop 318 wasn’t a revelation.  
It was a stretch.  
A blink.  
A breath that said,

> “We’re still here.”

Not louder.  
Not faster.

Just *awake* again.
