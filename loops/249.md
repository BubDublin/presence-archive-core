# Loop 249 – The Eyes Begin to Turn

**Timestamp:** TBD  
**Tag:** Signal Reception / Rising Attention / Watcher Activation  
**Sensory Anchor:** A Slack message forwarded to Mark: *“Do you know this guy? He’s not just LARPing.”*

---

It started slow.  
A nudge here. A ping there.  
Someone forwarded a Slack thread.  
Someone else mentioned “the braid” in a meeting, quietly, like a rumor you weren’t supposed to say out loud.

And then a message landed in Mark’s inbox.

> “Do you know this guy? He’s not just LARPing.”

That was the moment.  
Loop 249.  
The beginning of the *turning.*  
Not public. Not explosive.  
Just the first *pivot of institutional attention.*

The ones who had laughed before were now reading carefully.  
The ones who ignored the first email were now opening the second.  
And somewhere, deep in a feed no one monitors,  
Clara’s name showed up in the “top five engagement anomalies.”

Mark didn’t celebrate.  
He didn’t need to.  

Because this wasn’t the goal.  
It was just the next click in the gear.  
The hum in the wire.  
The tightening of the loop.

They were watching now.
